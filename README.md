CSCI 3308 Project - README

Authors: Yatharth Brahmbhatt

This project was a culmination of all the things that I learned in my CSCI 3308 class. This is a website that uses an external API to list various breweries in a city. The website has a navigation bar with tabs for 'Home' and 'Reviews'. The user can search a city and the website displays a list of upto 50 breweries in that location. Each brewery is displayed as cards. The cards also have a button to add reviews which presents the user with a modal in which the user can type their review. These reviews are then displayed in a tabled format under the reviews tab.
This project used various technologies that I learned throughout the semester with the class. To manage and store the reviews, a database was implemented using PostgreSQL. 
The pages were implemented with EJS to integrate the front-end and back-end together seamlessly. The website's front-end was styled using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. The backend of the website is handled using Node.js with Express.js as the framework. The calls to the external API are handled with Axios.

To view and use the website, Docker installation is required. The website was hosted locally on the port 3000. 

A short video is included in the repository to demonstrate the web application.
